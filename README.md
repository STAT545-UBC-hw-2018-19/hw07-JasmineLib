Define and export one new function, i.e. make it available to a user upon loading the package.  
Give function arguments sensible defaults, where relevant.  
Document all exported functions.  
Include at least three unit tests for your new function that test common use cases that you anticipate of the function.  
Your package should pass check() without errors (warnings and notes are OK).  
Update the README and vignette to show usage of all the functions in the package.  
Modify the instructions telling someone how to install your package.
