Define and export one new function, i.e. make it available to a user upon loading the package.  | New function root( )  |   
Document all exported functions.         |   |   
Include at least three unit tests for your new function that test common use cases that you anticipate of the function.  | testing complete in the test_root.R file |   
Give function arguments sensible defaults, where relevant.    |  root() has the default (x,2), such that it defaults to taking the square root. |   
Your package should pass check() without errors (warnings and notes are OK).  |  This passed for me! |   
Update the README and vignette to show usage of all the functions in the package.           | vignette updated  |   
Modify the instructions telling someone how to install your package.       |      See below for instructions on how to install package         |
